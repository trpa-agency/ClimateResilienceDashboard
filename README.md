# ClimateResilienceDashboard
A repo of data engineering and data visualizations to support the Climate Resilience Dashboard on LTinfo.

## Draft Visualizations

### Goal 1: Track Changing Climate Conditions

* [1.1(a) Total GHG emissions by Sector](html/1.1(a)_GHG.html)
* [1.3(c) Lake clarity measured by Secchi Depth](html/1.3(c)_Secchi_Depth.html)

### Goal 2: Promote Resilient Natural Systems

### Goal 3:Support Resilient Built Systems

* [3.2(a) Percent of renewable energy as a share of total energy used](html/3.2(a)_EnergyMix.html)

### Goal 4: Support Resilient Social Systems
